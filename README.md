A distributed program in MPI in which the processes are grouped in a topology formed of three clusters, each with a coordinator and an arbitrary number of worker processes. Worker processes in a cluster can only communicate with their coordinator, and all three coordinators can communicate with each other to connect clusters. All worker processes must be able to work together, with the help of coordinators, to solve computational tasks. This will be done by establishing the topology and dissemination to all processes, and then by sharing the calculations as evenly as possible between the workers.
